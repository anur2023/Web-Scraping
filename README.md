# Web Scraping Projects: Cricket and COVID-19 Data

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to scrape data from various web sources. The primary focus is on gathering cricket statistics from major tournaments and matches, as well as collecting data related to the Coronavirus pandemic.

## Description

The project uses web scraping techniques to automatically extract structured data from websites and save it into CSV files for analysis. It includes scrapers for:
*   T20 World Cup 2024 player statistics (batting and bowling).
*   Match information for an India vs. Bangladesh test match.
*   Global and country-wise Coronavirus statistics.

## Features

*   **Cricket Stats Scraper**: Extracts detailed batting and bowling statistics from the T20 World Cup 2024.
*   **Coronavirus Data Scraper**: Gathers key metrics on the COVID-19 pandemic.
*   **Data Export**: Saves all scraped data into clean, easy-to-use CSV files.
*   **Selenium-Based**: Utilizes Selenium and ChromeDriver for scraping dynamic websites that require browser automation.

## Datasets

The following datasets are generated by the scrapers:

*   `T20WorldCupBattersData.csv`: Contains batting statistics for players in the T20 World Cup 2024.
*   `T20WorldCupBollersData.csv`: Contains bowling statistics for players in the T20 World Cup 2024.
*   `CoronaVirusData.csv`: Provides data related to the Coronavirus pandemic.
*   `Test_cricket_data.csv`: Includes data from a test cricket match.

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language**: Python
*   **Web Scraping Libraries**: Selenium, BeautifulSoup
*   **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
*   **Web Driver**: ChromeDriver


    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```
    pip install selenium pandas beautifulsoup4
    ```

3.  **Set up ChromeDriver:**
    The `chromedriver-win64` folder is included in this repository. Ensure that the path to `chromedriver.exe` is correctly configured in the Python scripts or added to your system's PATH.

## How to Use

Navigate to the project directory and run the desired Python script from your terminal.

*   **To scrape T20 World Cup batters' data:**
    ```
    python T20WorldCupBatters2024.py
    ```

*   **To scrape T20 World Cup bowlers' data:**
    ```
    python T20WorldCupBollers2024.py
    ```

*   **To scrape Coronavirus data:**
    ```
    python coronavirus.py
    ```
The script will execute, scrape the data from the target website, and save the results in the corresponding `.csv` file in the root directory.
